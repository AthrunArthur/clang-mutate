Mutate C-family source code files with Clang

Simply running make should build the mutate executable.

The mutate script supports the following operations.

1. Numbering the statement in a source code file

     ./mutate n hello.c

   will result in the creation of a hello_num.c file in which each
   statement is bracketed with its numerical identifier.

2. Any of these statements may then be deleted, e.g.,

     ./mutate d:2 hello.c

   will result in the creation of a hello_del.c file in which the
   second statement has been deleted.

3. Any of these statements may be copied back into the file, e.g.,

     ./mutate i:4:7 hello.c
     less hello_ins.c

4. Similarly two statement may be swapped, e.g. the following swaps
   two puts statements,

     ./mutate s:28:26 hello.c
     less hello_swp.c
