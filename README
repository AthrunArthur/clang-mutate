Manipulate C-family ASTs with Clang

Running "make check" will do the following.

1. Compile the clang-mutate executable which uses Clang's LibTooling
   http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html

2. Build a trivial Compilation Database needed by clang tools
   http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html

3. Use clang-mutate to number all statements in the hello.c file
   
     ./clang-mutate n hello.c
